# credit_card_fraud_detection


A machine learning based project that identifies suspicious transactions using data-driven patterns and predictive modelling approach.


**Description**

Credit Card Fraud Detection is a machine learning classification project aimed at detecting fraudulent transactions by analysing historical transaction patterns.
The model helps banks, fintech products and financial security teams identify & flag potential fraud cases before loss happens.

It mainly focuses on maximising recall because in fraud detection – catching maximum fraud cases is more important than mis-classifying some normal transactions.


**Tech Stack**


This project was developed using the following tools & technologies:


🐍 Python – Core programming & model building

📊 Pandas / NumPy – Data cleaning & preprocessing

🔎 Scikit-Learn – ML model training & testing

📈 Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization & EDA

📁 Jupyter Notebook – Experimentation & documentation


**Data Source**

Source: Credit Card Transactions dataset (csv)

Dataset includes information about:

Transaction Amount

Transaction Time

Transaction Type

Merchant details

Status (Fraud / Legit)

This dataset helps understand behavioural transaction patterns and identify anomalies that indicate fraud.


**Features**

•**Business Problem**

Financial organizations receive millions of transactions daily but detecting fraud in real-time is extremely challenging because fraudulent cases are very small compared to genuine ones.

• **Goal of the Project**

To build a predictive model that can:

Detect fraudulent cases using features & patterns

Reduce financial risks for institutions

Improve fraud monitoring & prevention strategies

• **Modelling Steps**

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle Imbalance using SMOTE

Model Training 

Model Evaluation using  Acurracy score


• **Business Impact & Insights**

Increases security in online payments

Helps financial companies reduce fraud-related losses

Improves customer trust and safety

Supports risk & compliance monitoring teams
